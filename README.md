# Square Repositories App

## Introduction

Square Repositories App is a sample Android application that allows users to browse and view
information about square repositories. It utilizes modern Android development practices and
libraries to demonstrate best practices in app architecture, UI design, networking, and testing.

## Features

* **List Repositories:** Displays a list of square repositories with details such as name,
  description, creation date, and more.
* **Error Handling:** Handles network errors, empty responses, and other exceptions gracefully.
* **Network Connection:** Utilizes Retrofit for making API requests and managing network operations.
* **Jetpack Compose UI:** Utilizes Jetpack Compose for building the UI with a modern and declarative
  approach..

## Technology Stack

* **Kotlin:** The app is developed using the Kotlin programming language, which provides a concise
  and expressive way of writing Android code.
* **MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern,
  separating the concerns of data, UI, and business logic.
* **Android Jetpack:** Utilizes ViewModel for managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
* **Jetpack Compose:** The app's UI is built using Jetpack Compose, a modern and declarative UI
  toolkit for building native Android UI.
* **Coroutines:** Kotlin coroutines are used for asynchronous programming, enabling efficient and
  responsive network operations.
* **Flows:** The Kotlin Flow library is used for reactive programming, allowing seamless management
  of data streams and updates.
* **Hilt:** The dependency injection library, is used to manage dependencies and promote a modular
  and testable codebase.
* **Retrofit:** Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP client, is used to make API calls to the Star Wars API
  and
  retrieve planet data.
* **Unit Testing:** The app includes comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of business
  and presentation logic, ensure code reliability, and cover all scenarios including positive,
  negative, and edge cases with full test coverage.
* **UI Testing:** Implemented using Compose Testing to validate the app's UI components and user
  interactions across positive, negative, and edge case scenarios.

## SOLID Principles

In the Square Repositories App, SOLID principles are applied by ensuring classes have clear
responsibilities, interfaces define specific contracts, implementations are interchangeable via
dependency injection with Hilt, and new features can be added without modifying existing code,
fostering maintainability and extensibility.

## Demonstration

Provides a simple demo to showcase how to fetch and display square repository data using the app.

## Future Enhancements

To further improve the app, consider adding the following features:

* Offline Support: Integrate local database caching using Room to support offline access to
  repository data.
* Enhanced Error Handling: Expand error handling to cover more edge cases and provide informative
  user feedback.
* User Authentication: Introduce user authentication using OAuth for personalized repository
  browsing.
* UI/UX Enhancements: Polish the UI design, animations, and transitions for a more polished user
  interface.
* Accessibility: Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing
  accessibility features.

## Conclusion

The Square Repositories App serves as a practical example of modern Android app development using
MVVM architecture, Kotlin coroutines, Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, and Hilt. It demonstrates how to
build a responsive and maintainable application while adhering to best practices, SOLID principles,
and UI design guidelines.
